# PhysiCoaster
PhysiCoaster is an educational game which teaches middle-schoolers the relationship between kinetic and potential energy. Players must build a roller coaster that can take the cart from the starting point to the finish line. This is a project where my teammates and I worked directly with a client to produce a product for use as a teaching tool.

# My Contributions to the Project:
- Created the system for building and editing the roller coaster track
- Programmed the bar and line graphs to display accurate readings for kinetic and potential energy
- Utilized real-world physics equations to calculate the kinetic and potential energy acting on the cart at any given time
- Assisted teammates in resolving scripting-oriented obstacles, most notably the logic for how the cart moves
- Met with our client, alongside my teammates, to ask questions, show our progress, and revise our game
